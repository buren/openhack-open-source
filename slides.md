## Archiving certain USGOV sites in response to Trump

Professors were scared that the Trump administration would withdraw funding for certain gov-sites.

They started mass-archiving sites to the Internet Archive.

### Big open sourceâ„¢

* Modern open source
  - Google (TensorFlow, Kubernetes, Angular, ...)
  - Facebook (React, HHVM, jest, ...) and what about their patent-clause?
  - Microsoft, yes Microsoft.. (dotnet, vscode, TypeScript, ..)
* Could open source be used in new places?
  - Outside of software?
  - Open source banks? governments?
  - Why aren't governments institutions open sourcing their code???
    - WHY?!?#!@#^! :hocho:

## How can I get started contributing?

* Contributing to a OSS project
  - Start small
  - Read some old pull requests and issues
  - Validate that your change is needed
  - Be nice :smiley:
  - Spend time on writing good issues and pull requests
* Building a OSS project
  - Build something yourselves
  - Being a maintainer can be hard
  - People are _not always_ nice

Remember the code from the first slide?

```ruby
include OpenHack

author = Presenter.new(:buren)
slides = OpenSource::Slides.new

wait until author.ready?

author.present(slides) do |slide|
  print slide
  any_questions? if slide.last?
end
```

---

```ruby
DEADLINE = Time.new(2017, 6, 3, 14, 30, 0).freeze
module OpenHack;end
module OpenHack::OpenSource;end
String.class_eval { define_method(:last?) { false } }
NilClass.class_eval { define_method(:last?) { true } }
define_method(:wait) { puts 'Still not ready..';sleep 3 }
define_method(:any_questions?) { puts 'Any questions?' }
define_method(:feedback) { puts 'Feedback?' }
class OpenHack::Presenter < Struct.new(:name)
  define_method(:ready?) { Time.now >= DEADLINE }
  def present(slides); slides.to_a.each { |slide| yield(slide) };end
end
class OpenHack::OpenSource::Slides
  define_method(:initialize) { @slides = File.read('slides.md').split('---') }
  define_method(:to_a) { @slides + [nil] }
end
```

This actually makes the previous code work :trollface:
